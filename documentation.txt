--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOUCH-TYPING ( or blind-typing):
    It is the skill to type without looking at the keys on the keyboard.This series of exercises is designed 
    to help someone learning touch-typing. We havechosen the standard USA keyboard layout. This layout is the 
    most common with manykeyboards that come with laptops or standalone keyboards. Should you meet anotherkeyboard layout,
    there won't be such a big difference on the way keys are arranged. Weguarantee you won't  struggle much with it,
    because only a few keys will be interchangedand there will always be a regular pattern With touch-typing 
    you don't have to look at the keys of the keyboard to identify whichkey to press. 
    The exercises are designed in a way that at the end you will have masteredwhich fingers type which letters on a keyboard.
    Speed is gained with practice.
